\chapter{Soundness}
\label{chap:soundness}

In \autoref{sec:lrec_analysis}, a number of transformations were introduced in order to rewrite left-recursive productions into an iterative form, utilising \texttt{postfix}.
This chapter dives deeper into these transformations to prove equivalences in the normalisation (\autoref{sec:sound_normalisation}) and reduction (\autoref{sec:sound_reductions}) steps, as well as verifying the correctness of rewriting a recursive production in an iterative manner (\autoref{sec:sound_rewrite}).

\section*{Summary}
This chapter verifies the operations performed to support grammar refactoring, ensuring that the desired semantics are maintained throughout an arbitrary number of transformations.
By validating the transformations via equivalences and structural induction over a single grammar rule, left recursion analysis and the subsequent refactoring are shown to be sound.
